# Here be data extracts from webpages and videos.

What started out as a simple query - Lets find how many faults (or lets) were called in badminton matches - led to the start of this repository. 

A popular opinion was that there were more service faults, and of the 'above waist' (or 'too high') category. And that the player who was responsible for the let situation, benefitted. However, there was no database, public or commercial, to search. As of Jan 2021, there still is not.

With data, an inquiry could be made, what type of faults, service, touching shuttle twice, encroaching opponent's court, etc. When let was called, why.
